# Contributing to ezPIE [DRAFT]
We’d love for you to contribute to our source code and to make ezPIE even better than it is today!  Here are the guidelines we’d like you to follow.

## Code of Conduct
As contributors and maintainers of the ezPIE project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of the channels must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the ezPIE project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the ezPIE project may take action, removing issues, comments, and pull requests or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

## Review the License Agreement
By creating a pull request or contributing to ezPIE you are agreeing to the [Fannie Mae Open Source License](license.md)
## Learning the Basics
Not sure what a pull request is, or how to submit one? Take a look at GitHub's excellent help documentation first.

## ezPIE Code Branches
The project has two major branches.  The “master” branch is reserved for Fannie Mae employee contributions.  The “osmaster” branch contains all of the code from “master” and includes merged contributions from the open source community.  

## Want a Feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.  However if you would like to implement the new feature consider the level of effort required first.
* Major changes should be discussed with the project architect before you start.  Use the email address from the Fannie Mae open-source community page. 
* Minor changes or bug fixes can be submitted as a pull request.

## Got a Question?
Check the project documentation in the wiki; we are constantly adding new material.  The documentation is not only a reference; it also contains example definitions for common situations.
