# ezPIE® Automation Framework

ezPIE® is just that, Easy as Pie! But I guess you are wondering "just what is PIE"? ezPIE is an open source workflow orchestrator built to automate heavy-weight platforms to be DevOps compatible. At Fannie Mae we built ezPIE (as a flexible orchestrator) to automate self-service automation of both onboarding and scanning of applications to CAST AIP so the platform can be integrated within our DevOps platform. While PIE was built to automate CAST AIP within the framework of DevOps it was built to be CAST agnostic and applicable to any orchestration need. So why not Jenkins? Jenkins is a specialized orchestrator for CICD; while we looked at it as a solution and even connect with Jenkins, it did not meet the bill due to the amount of data transformations that needed to be executed.
